# Reading Time Badge Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension adds a simple reading time estimate (e.g., `⏱️ 3 min read`) to articles on any webpage you visit.

It scans the article content, calculates the word count, and inserts a badge right after the article title (or at the top if no title is found). Works on popular platforms like Wikipedia, blogs, news sites, and documentation pages.
